		<p>I love how Wikipedia shows you a preview of a page when you hover over a link to another page in a wiki entry. This makes Wikipedia more navigable for me, particularly if I am only looking for a definition of a term (text that appears in the preview) to help me better understand the contents on a page. This got me thinking about adding a hover feature to my website that would show you a preview of links that appear in my blog posts.</p>
<p>The IndieWeb wiki already had an entry on this topic. The IndieWeb wiki refers to tooltips that appear when you hover over a link as a "<a href="https://indieweb.org/hovercard">hovercard</a>". There has been a lot of brainstorming on this topic, and reading over the page made me realise how much is possible. I decided to start small and simple. I set a goal to add hovercards to the links in my blog post. Hovercards would show:</p>
<ol>
<li>The title of the linked page.</li>
<li>A short description of the linked page (if one can be found).</li>
<li>An image representing the page (if one can be found).</li>
</ol>
